Cartography for Spain


Cartography for Spain downloaded from the [Global Administrative Areas](http://www.gadm.org/) and converted from shapefiles to geojson files using the [shapefile parser](https://github.com/mbostock/shapefile/blob/master/README.md#shp2json)

The files represent 5 administrative levels (from the whole country to municipalities)
